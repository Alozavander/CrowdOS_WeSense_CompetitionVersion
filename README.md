# Introduction

WeSense is a Crowdsensing application in Android, which allows all users to register accounts to become Participants to receive sensing tasks or become Publishers to publish sensing tasks. WeSense collects the sensor data of the smart device and upload them to CrowdOS Server to finish the sensing tasks, so as to solve the problem of idle sensing capabilities. The WeSense sensing task supports custom sensor requirements. The sensing data collection page is opened, allowing users to view or delete the sensing data produced by smart devices. WeSense currently supports both Chinese and English.
